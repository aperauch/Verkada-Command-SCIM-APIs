# Verkada Command SCIM APIs

This Postman collection documents SCIM API endpoints used by Verkada Command. These SCIM APIs can be called directly using Postman for testing purposes.

To get started, find or create your SCIM bearer token from your Verkada Command Org. If you do not have a Command Org, you can create one [here](https://help.verkada.com/en/articles/1143779-get-started-with-verkada-command). After you've created a Command Org, follow these steps to create or refresh a bearer token for your Command Org and to find your SCIM tenant URL.

The SCIM tenant URL will change based on the region where the Command Org was created. Here are the two regional domains used currently:

- US
    - Region Domain: api.command.verkada.com
    - SCIM Tenant URL: [https://api.command.verkada.com/scim](https://api.command.verkada.com/scim.)
- EU
    - Region Domain: scim.prod2.verkada.com
    - SCIM Tenant URL: [<b>h</b>ttps://scim.prod2.verkada.com/scim](https://scim.prod2.verkada.com/scim)
